# Mood-Tracker

In this project we created a platform to track your own and friend's mental wellbeing. Our motivation behind this is to support peopleâ€™s mental health through self help. Our initial plan for this application was to have a custom slider, where a user choses their daily mood (from between 0 and 10) and create a graph of their moods throughout the week. We achieved this goal and implemented additionally features. The two main features were the ability to view other user's mood graphs and being able to put in a mood level for a past missed day. The problem that our application solves is it boosts positivity in the current circumstances of the world. Where people's mental healths has been significantly affected. We have two main learning points that we will implement in future applications. The first is that different CSS frameworks work better or worse with handlebars; and the second is that an application can work locally but won't necessarily work deployed.
